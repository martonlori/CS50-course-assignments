# CS50 Course Assignments

This repository contains assignments, projects, and solutions completed during the **CS50x** and **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python** (CS50P) courses.

## CS50x Overview
**CS50x**, Harvard University’s introductory computer science course, comprises **11 comprehensive modules**. Participants complete a total of **9 substantial problem sets** and a **capstone project**, showcasing a robust understanding of key computer science principles.

Key topics include:
- **C Programming:** Advanced memory management, pointer arithmetic, and efficient data structures like linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures:** A range of efficient sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort), recursion, and performance analysis.
- **Web Development:** Developing responsive web pages and applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, culminating in a fully functional web project.
- **Databases and SQL:** Storing, querying, and manipulating data using SQL. Understanding how to normalize databases, write complex queries, and integrate SQL with application code.
- **Computer Science Foundations:** Binary representation, cryptography techniques, and detailed exploration of how computers execute code at the hardware level.

Each module includes in-depth lectures, hands-on labs, and rigorous problem sets that challenge participants to apply theoretical concepts in practical, real-world scenarios. The final project allows for the design and implementation of a sophisticated software solution.

## CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)
**CS50P** comprises **10 comprehensive units** that focus on Python programming to develop versatile problem-solving skills. The curriculum includes **8 well-rounded problem sets** and a **final project**, addressing areas such as:
- **Python Programming:** Variables, loops, control structures, and functions.
- **Data Structures and Collections:** Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
- **File Handling and Exceptions:** Efficient file processing and robust error handling strategies.
- **Databases and SQL:** Leveraging SQLite to create and query databases, integrate structured data into Python applications, and perform advanced data manipulations.
- **Libraries and Modules:** Leveraging Python’s standard library and external packages for sophisticated tasks.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Designing maintainable code through classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- **APIs and Data Parsing:** Interacting with RESTful APIs, extracting and analyzing JSON data, and working with more complex data structures.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Developing and executing comprehensive test suites, as well as advanced debugging methods.

The structured progression of these units provides real-world applications, such as data analysis, file processing, and building functional utilities. The final project allows participants to demonstrate their mastery by delivering a fully operational Python-based solution to a meaningful challenge.
